# Optimizing Chemical Reactions for Environmental Sustainability
### Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the decomposition of plastic materials by simulating massive alkane cracking processes. Using high-performance computing techniques, we ran hundreds of thousands of catalytic reactions to improve environmental sustainability efforts, leveraging supercomputing power and parallel computing for enhanced data processing.

### Key Features
- **Parallel Computing**: Expedited simulations using parallel processing for handling large datasets.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automated data handling and process management on a Unix-based system.
- **SQL & Remote Server Databases**: Managed and queried large-scale data remotely for efficient performance optimization.
  
### Tech Stack
- Command Line, Unix, SQL, Excel
- Parallel computing techniques on supercomputers
- Shell scripts for simulation execution give me a short github description
